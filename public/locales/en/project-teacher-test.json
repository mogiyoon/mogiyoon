    "description": "Tea Time is a mobile learning app designed for pre-service teachers preparing for the Korean elementary teacher certification exam. It helps candidates study the vast curriculum anytime, anywhere through quiz-based learning, while systematically managing incorrect answers to bring them closer to success. Built with Flutter, the app is designed to allow efficient learning of key content during commute times or short breaks.",

Wrong answers are managed in Firestore, with each incorrect question and timestamp uploaded after a test. On other devices, data is synchronized if the locally stored timestamp is outdated."
